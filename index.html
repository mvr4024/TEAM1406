<h1>Opportunties and Risks of Artifical Intelligence in Society</h1>
<h4>Summary</h4>
<p>Nadimpalli (2017) puts into conclusion that, artificial intelligence has its benefits and risks. Society can benefit both from 
	artificial intelligence as well as potentially suffer from it. The fact that artificial intelligence could create some of the 
	best outcomes and produce a high-quality product is very significant. Artificial intelligence especially has tremendous benefits 
	in the field of medical or health, education, transportation, as well as enhancing human activities, and markets. On the other 
	hand, artificial intelligence has the overall misconceptions and risks of replacing human beings as well as reducing their 
	emotional aspects, observing them as machines as opposed to human beings.</p>
