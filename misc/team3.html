<h2>Ethical issues relating to Artificial Intelligence </h2>

<p>The ever developing area of Artifical Intelligence (AI) requires the implementation of it in real-word scenarios. The more
  it gets implemented into society, the more risks it poses. This is because AI is getting more and more access to real-word devices 
  the more it's being used and implemented both personally and professionally. This could cause security vulnerabilities and other internal vulnerabilities.
</br></br>
  Using Artificial Intelligence in real-world scenarios creates problems when it comes to ethics. Do we want to allow the intelligence to be 
  smarter than humans and possibly cause a terminator-type world where the artificial intelligence takes over and "ruins the world", This is 
  a very real possibility as aritifical intelligence would increase their knowledge to a higher point then humans but without the ethics or morals
  that humans have.
</br></br>
  Another possible ethical issue would be the replacing of jobs for humans, these jobs being overtaken by Artificial Intelligece.
  This would cause outrage due to the ever-increasing unemployment rate that would happen because of this. The more companies that 
  use automation instead of humans as workers, the more civil unrest will be caused by the lack of job opportunities.
</br></br>
  An intimidating ethical issue would be the idea that Artificial Intelligence would have a higher level of knowldge compared to humans
  this would cause a lack of self worth to society and the human race from those who feel 'inferior'. Due to the idea that Artificial Intelligence could overtake
  human intelligence, this would cause the lack of needing to do necessary tasks due to 'robots' doing it for the humans, meaning they will lose the basic needs and skills
  required to live without the use of Artifical Intelligence.
</p>

<h2>Personal Reflection</h2>
<p>In the past we've seen examples of security vulnerabilities being exploited by humans, this would get worse with the development of Artificial Intelligence
  as it's like the breacher having unlimited knowledge with an Artificial Intelligence based program behind it. This causes a lot of ethical issues as it means
  passwords, bank information and other private information would be vulnerable to people with access to the Artificial Intelligence. Not only information but also devices,
  devices used in medical or emergency services could be more vulnerable and the more things are technologically advanced, the more at risk it is to a breach or risk of Artificial Intelligence.
  This is a large ethical issue which I think would need to be combatted for the development of Artificial Intelligence to continue advancing.
</br></br>
  The idea of Artificial Intelligence being smarter than humans is scary but acceptable. The idea that Artifical Intelligence could rule the world is associated with an impending doom
  but this could be good for our society as it takes away a lot of the stress associated with knowledge and learning whilst also still allowing humans to excel.
</br></br>
  The replacement of jobs by Artificial Intelligence is an issue that would definitely need to be addressed as asking a large group of people to retrain professions
  purely because robots and Artificial Intelligence is more efficient is harsh and unethical but it is happening more and more as the years go forward.
