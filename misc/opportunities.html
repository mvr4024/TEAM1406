<h1>Opportunities and Benefits of Artifical Intelligence</h1>
</ul>
<p>Gibbons (2021) states that we as humans should be aware of how artificial intelligence can 
  bring massive opportunities and benefits especially to under-served populations, the advancement 
  of equal access to public services such as education, health, transportation, or assistance.</p>

<h4>Education</h4>
<p>The increase of advancement of computing in technologies has promote and aid the implementation of 
  Artificial Intelligence in Education (AIED) applications. Hwang et al. (2020) explains that Artificial 
  Intelligence in Education refer to the purpose and use of artificial intelligence application programs 
  or technologies in education to help teaching, learning, or decision making. In particular, with the 
  help of artificial intelligence technologies, which simulate human behavior or intellectual mind to 
  make interpretations, arguments, or predictions, computer systems can provide supports, guidance, or 
  feedbacks to students as well as assisting lecturers or teachers in decision-making.</br></br>
  For example, according to Hwang et al. (2020), the application of artificial intelligence could play a 
   of a tutor who observes students’ processes of learning, monitoring and analyzing their learning 
   performance, as well as providing instant assistance according to their needs. Based on the potential 
   needs of students, a team composed of learning and computer scientists can program and develop a 
   system that is intelligence or with intellectual mind that enables the students to practice, learn, 
   and interact with teachers or peers as well as creating guidance, hints, and supports to the 
   individuals according to their needs or status. In contrast, as we can predict the features and 
   capabilities of artificial intelligence technologies, lecturers or school teachers could adopt 
   specific application into the artificial intelligence system in their classes to increase and aid 
   students’ motivation, learning processes and performances, or engagement. These ideas can be delivered
    to the educational researchers who can study the implications of artificial intelligence applications.
