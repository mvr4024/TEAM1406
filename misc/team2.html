<h4><em>Ethical issues relating to artificial intelligence<br><br>

The development and improvement of artificial intelligence systems comes out with the idea that machines should have responsibility, which therefore, should have ethical attributes. In addition, these developments of artificial intelligence systems should have ethical features when used  to make decisions such as scenario judgement and analysis. Currently, the implementation of ethics into artificial intelligence has become the key research of its development (Chao, 2019).
Ethics of artificial intelligence focuses on the importance of behaviors that machines bring to other machines, and especially towards human decisions (Chao, 2019). One of the primary examples is the application of self-driving vehicles, this artificial intelligence machine has to be able to make ethical decisions.
According to Baum (2019, as cited in Chao, 2019), one of the major ethical issues of artificial intelligence is the use of social choice by the intelligent systems, in which the artificial intelligence is implemented or designed to operate based on the collective views of the society. There is no particular moral ethics in society therefore, the basis of artificial intelligence social ethics choice is fragile and unsteady because of the fact that there is no combined one point of view from the society regarding ethics. The proposal design of artificial intelligence should include three things: standing, regarding whose ethics views are compromised; measurement, the identification of their views towards the society; and aggregation, how the united views of the society can be made into a single view that can model and guide artificial intelligence performance. The design of artificial intelligence should be implemented through pre-defined decisions. All the questions are more significant than debatable decision of using the society to choose ethical problems. The key point should be on these issues, and not on the choice of social decisions.
The algorithm of ethics towards artificial intelligence should be the decision-making acts of these autonomous systems. These systems have to be reliable and secure.  The artificial intelligence of these devices or machines should be safe towards the society, it should be able to make moral decisions better than human beings. Researchers, designers, and engineers of artificial intelligence or the society should clarify how these machines or vehicles make moral decisions that is morality of artificial intelligence.

Personal Reflections<br><br>

Throughout my research of artificial intelligence in society, I personally found that there are more opportunities and benefits of artificial intelligence systems than there are risks. There are many positive impacts that the people can benefit from this controversial idea. However, the society have to think of the future impacts of having these systems in our lives, whether or not these intelligent machines will pose risks for the society. The final automation of artificial intelligence systems will not be concluded until few decades from now, therefore, I personally think that we should only focus on the benefits of it and what it has done for us so far, in terms with our education, health, or life. As a university student who is only come across this topic recently, I would like to focus on the positive aspects of this technology and the benefits that I have received from these machines or technologies. And I personally think that the potential risks or negative aspects of this technology should be put in the hands of the people who are more experienced in this field. These people should think that there is a potential that these technologies might replace human beings. In addition, final major decisions of the design and model of potential future intelligent machines should include the societyâ€™s point of view.

Recommendations<br><br>

The concept of artificial intelligent machines is the implementation of intelligence into the devices such as robots, machines, or vehicles. My personal recommendation is that these machines should not replace humans especially in their jobs. The automation of these machines should replace skills, not jobs, they should be able to assist humans in aspects of their lives and not overtaking them. All the scientists, engineers, researchers of this technology should think that the system of this technology do not have to overtake people; they only have to implement significant ways of having these machines to perform effective and helpful tasks with much responsibility. These machines should have new skills, preferably something that humans cannot perform or humans cannot do instantly, therefore they would not be taking over humans lives but instead corporate with them for better outcome.
