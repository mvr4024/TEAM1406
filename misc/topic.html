<h1>Artificial Intelligence</h1>
</ul>
<h4>Defining Artificial Intelligence:</h4>
<p>Throughout many years the exact definition of artificial intelligence cannot be defined. 
  There are two reasons as to why this concept is hard to explain. First, the meaning of 
  intelligence or exact definition of intelligence is controversial, many people had disagreement 
  regarding this topic. Secondly, there is insufficient reason to believe that the intelligence of the 
  machine can bear much relationship to human intelligence. Since there are many definitions of 
  artificial intelligence, each with its own interpretation, the one that is most aligned around the 
  ideas or concepts of this is the creation of computer programs or machines that are competent, 
  efficient, and capable of behavior that we as human beings would regard as intelligent (Kaplan, 2016). 
  Kaplan (2016) also explains how the founding father of artificial intelligence John McCarthy, 
  described the definition in 1955 as the process of machine to behave in ways that is considered 
  intelligent as if a human were so behaving.</p>

<h4>History of Artificial Intelligence:</h4>
<p>The term artificial intelligence came from a specific individual named John McCarthy, in 1956. 
  He was the first person to contribute this term. John and other researchers proposed a very specific 
  study of artificial intelligence. This study focused on proceeding the process of every aspect of 
  learning or features of intelligence that can be implemented into the machine which allows it to 
  simulate these specific behaviors or attributes (Kaplan, 2016). The use of language in terms with 
  abstractions and concepts in machines was also greatly planned and considered. According to Kaplan
  (2016), John McCarthy also focused on how to generate and manufacture these machines into doing 
  specific tasks that could get the machines to solve different kinds of problems for humans, as 
  well as improving themselves.</p>

  <h4>Philosphy involved with Artifical Intelligence: </h4>
  <p>Many people considered artificial intelligence to be a controversial topic. Artificial intelligence
     is typically the target of vociferous criticisms from various sections of humanities. One example 
     stated by Kaplan (2016) is how artificial intelligence pose real challenges to religious and 
     philosophical people about human uniqueness and our place in the universe. These intelligent 
     machines raise potential to project questions and criticism from humans whether the nature of human 
     minds, or the existence of free will are alive. Throughout history the concept of artificial 
     intelligence has been debated in both exciting and scary ways. However, in the end, these problems 
     come down to humans’ basic beliefs about themselves, some people will resist the ideas of scientific 
     explanations such as the existence of human soul. Another example by Kaplan (2016) is how according 
     to intellectual people the progress or existence of artificial intelligence may harm or threaten the 
     livelihoods which could lead to the actual lives of many people. To put into short conclusion, 
     the philosophy of artificial intelligence is to question whether how the computers, or smart 
     machines in general or anything in that region can be said to have any mind, which allows it to think. 
     Simply put, everything depends on the individual’s interpretation of “mind” and “think”.</p>

  <h4>Impact of Artifical Intelligence:</h4>
  <p>The development of economic output and productivity have been increased through the help of 
    technological improvements of artificial intelligence (Kaplan, 2016). Artificial intelligence will 
    lead to significant changes in the modern world. The revolutionary of technologies has extremely 
    change the lives of people. Presently, artificial intelligence has already been implemented into 
    several human activities that are mostly in terms with economic, informational, medical, cultural, 
    and social life (Fehler, 2017, as cited in Boukerche et al., 2020)</p>
