<p>According to Cellan-Jones (2014, as cited in Boukerche et al., 2020), the use and creation of artificial
   intelligence, especially since computers can perform such abilities, this will cause artificial 
   intelligence to exceed human intelligence. This could potentially surpass humans in every aspect 
   and respect. The current pace of development of artificial intelligence indicated that the first 
   breakthrough can happen in the years between 2045-2060. If such things occur, an avalanche changes 
   will happen, with unpredictable consequences, because the extended knowledge and capabilities of 
   artificial intelligence will be able to outdo people intellectually, and continually upgrade and 
   enhance themselves (Fehler, 2017, as cited in Boukerche et al., 2020).
</br></br>The main risk of artificial intelligence is that it could possibly replace human subjects, this 
brings the general problem of bringing people out of work. For example, companies that depending on 
artificial intelligence rely on decreasing the number human subjects or workers with whom they are 
involved. Therefore, this case brings major issues by the fact that it will reduce the number of workers 
who have the chance of benefitting from the employment opportunities (Nadimpalli, 2017).
</br></br>Another misconception associated with artificial intelligence is that there is a chance of creating 
issue of replacing the intelligence of humans.  This is expressed as an ethical case where more people 
would be relying and seek help from artificial intelligence, this issue was described as how humans will 
feel that their knowledge is not sufficient enough which therefore, should be replaced with the 
technologies of computers and machines. If this particular action is implemented human beings will 
lose the ability to handle various activities that would be purposeful or relevant to them. This 
process will also guide human beings to lose their general value towards humanity. The idea of how 
peopleâ€™s intelligence could be replaced by machines and computers is intimidating (Nadimpalli, 2017).
</br></br>Nadimpalli (2017) also states that artificial intelligence also has the chance of decreasing the 
general level of human emotions. In this modern world, people often outcome obstacles and problems 
through the help of computer systems or technologies, that human beings used to handle, this practices 
could result in making people feel out of touch with the general idea of emotional aspect. Such issue 
can convert people into machines.</p>
