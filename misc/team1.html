</h4><u>The Ethical Issues of Artificial Intelligence in Society:</u></h4><br><br>

Artificial Intelligence in Society, poses many ethical issues, concerning what role human judgment plays, in the implementation of artificial intelligence into society. For example, if self-driving vehicles didn’t possess ethical features, such as analysis and scenario judgment, it would lead to a lot of accidents on the road due to machine error.
Another example of a major ethical issue concerning artificial intelligence in society is the use of human decision-making when designing and implementing artificial intelligence, and how that decision-making is based upon the views of our society. The future design and implementation of artificial intelligence should take into consideration, the views of our society, and the many viewpoints of different cultures and religions around the world. Failure to do so will result in major turmoil and conflict in society, and endless debate about the subject.
Overall, these machines should and have to be reliable and secure. The implementation of artificial intelligence in society needs to be safe, and the machines should be able to make the correct ethical decisions to ensure trust and reliability from them.<br><br>

<u>Personal Reflections:</u><br><br>

When covering the topic of artificial intelligence in society wit, I found that the risks and opportunities, are both very important to consider, for the future of artificial intelligence. There are many risks to artificial intelligence in society, especially as it continues to grow. Many people will be scared and nervous about what artificial intelligence in society can become, and the potential threats that it may cause to humans in the future. But I feel the positives and opportunities of artificial intelligence would greatly push humanity forward and only see to improve us as a species. 
Even though artificial intelligence won’t fully be a thing for decades and decades, when it eventually gets perfected and implemented into our society, we as people, are the ones who have to dictate, how it is implemented into our lives and the potential limitations we may need to give it, if necessary.
Overall, I am excited about the future of artificial intelligence in society, I feel the benefits it gives to sectors, such as the education field, medical field, and transportation field, make it greatly important for the future of society.<br><br>

<u>Recommendations:</u><br><br>
	
My personal recommendation for implementing artificial intelligence in the future is that we as humans should not be fully reliant on artificial intelligence as a whole. What I mean by this is that artificial intelligence should not be replacing humans in their jobs, and we shouldn’t become over-reliant on artificial intelligence for day-to-day tasks. artificial intelligence replacing jobs, would greatly impact many lives in a negative way. Instead, we should implement AI into workspaces, in a way that makes a worker’s job easier, rather than fully replace them.
For example, as mentioned on the opportunities page, having an intelligent learning tool/partner to help teachers and students in class. Or having accurate clinical support and care, for detecting patients’ issues, and reporting that information to a doctor or nurse, so they can get the right help for the patient in need. Having artificial intelligence, be implemented in this way, so that it is not replacing humans in the workspace, and instead is helping workers and making their jobs easier, would greatly aid and improve a lot of jobs, only benefiting and making a lot of peoples lives easier and better.<br><br>
